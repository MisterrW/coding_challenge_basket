bogof

Array of mixed products, different types, different prices, some bogof and some not.

If two items in the array are of the same type and both are marked bogof, need to subtract the price of the lowest priced of those items from the total.



So,

1. create a copy of the items array and a bogofDiscount double with a value of 0
2. delete all items with a bogof of false
3. sort the array by price(descending)
4. for each item in the copied array:
    delete the item
    starting from the end of the remaining array and counting backwards:
      if another item in the array has the same class (getClass)
        -add the price of that item to bogofDiscount
        -delete that item from the array
